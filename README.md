# Image-Purification
To pass images through a clustering algorithm to produce a dataset of pure images. The process is repeated a few more times then we use the datasets produced for classification training. The purpose of this is to automate training.

IDEA IS ENTIRLEY MY OWN. Please if you see something similar do tell me. 

Disclaimer:

MOST CODE IS NOT MY OWN. THE CLUSTERING ALGORITHM IS FROM: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-cluster-images-based-on-visual-similarity-cd6e7209fe34 AND THE WEB SCRAPING IS FROM:
